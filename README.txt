Lifecycle: We will use a spiral lifecycle for the development of this project. We will focus on 
making testable elements of our requirements ASAP. Once we get a good idea of how all the pieces  
will work we will take a step back and re-focus our attention on how everything will work together

Subsystems: In very broad strokes - We would like the map and calendar to be (to use vague terms) very
responsive to the users input (type of events, location, desired dates, etc.) this means (more vague terms)
having as much as is reasonable of the event data available client side.

The server side code should fetch as much data as is reasonable from the databse and deliver it to the client
inside data structures that can be easily be used by Javascript.

We would like to keep the database as simple as possible while still maintaining properly normalized data.
